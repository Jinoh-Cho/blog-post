# Spectrally Pruned Gaussian Fields with Neural Compensation (SUNDAE)
*Authors: Yang, Runyi, et al

## Summary
3D Gaussian Splatting
- Pros: Superior rendering speed and quality
- Cons: High memory consumption

SUNDAE
- SUNDAE constructs a memory-efficient Gaussian field using spectral pruning and neural compensation. 
- SUNDAE considers the relationship between primitives, reducing memory usage while maintaining rendering quality.
- SUNDAE significantly reduces memory consumption while preserving high rendering quality.
