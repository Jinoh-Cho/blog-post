# Spectrally Pruned Gaussian Fields with Neural Compensation (SUNDAE)
*Authors: Yang, Runyi, et al

## Summary
Conventional 3D Gaussian Splatting
- Pros: Superior rendering speed and quality
- Cons: High memory consumption

Proposed SUNDAE
- It constructs a memory-efficient Gaussian field using spectral pruning and neural compensation. 
- It considers the relationship between primitives, reducing memory usage while maintaining rendering quality.
- It significantly reduces memory consumption while preserving high rendering quality.
- Code: https://runyiyang.github.io/projects/SUNDAE/.

Contributions
- A newly proposed primitive pruning framework for Gaussian fields based upon the spectrum of primitive graphs;
- A novel feature splatting and mixing module to compensate for the performance drop caused by the pruning;
- State-of-the-art results, in terms of both quality and speed, on various benchmarks with low memory footprint.
