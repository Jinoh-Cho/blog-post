# Spectrally Pruned Gaussian Fields with Neural Compensation (SUNDAE)
*Authors: Yang, Runyi, et al

## Summary
3D Gaussian Splatting
- Pros: Superior rendering speed and quality
- Cons: High memory consumption

SUNDAE
- It constructs a memory-efficient Gaussian field using spectral pruning and neural compensation. 
- It considers the relationship between primitives, reducing memory usage while maintaining rendering quality.
- It significantly reduces memory consumption while preserving high rendering quality.
- Code: https://runyiyang.github.io/projects/SUNDAE/.
