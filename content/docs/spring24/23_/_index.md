# **Beyond Language Models: Byte Models are Digital World Simulators**

Byte models expand traditional language models to the byte level, starting from the premise that all digital data and operations are fundamentally byte-based. These models process data from various modalities such as text, audio, and images uniformly as bytes, increasing their applicability in a wide digital environment.

In this paper, bGPT is introduced. bGPT is designed to model digital data at the byte level and is optimized to effectively process byte sequences. It has demonstrated performance comparable to specialized models across various modalities, including text, audio, and images, and offers new possibilities for predicting, simulating, and diagnosing hardware operations. Designed to predict and understand bytes, bGPT provides a deeper understanding of and interaction with digital systems.

The bGPT framework simulates digital systems using native binary data. It integrates diverse data types into a single model by treating everything as a byte sequence.
